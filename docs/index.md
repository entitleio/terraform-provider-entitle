description: |-
  The Entitle provider allows you to manage your Entitle https://www.entitle.io access, workflows, integrations, and policies within your Entitle environment using Infrastructure as Code.
  Use Cases
  Just-in-Time Access: Grant temporary elevated permissions for specific tasksBreak-Glass Access: Provide emergency access with proper approval and audit trailsOnboarding/Offboarding: Automate permission grants and revocations based on group membershipCompliance: Maintain audit trails and enforce approval workflowsCross-Application Access: Bundle permissions across AWS, GCP, Azure, and SaaS applications
  Authentication
  The provider requires an API key to authenticate with the Entitle API.
  Getting Your API Key
  To obtain an API key:
  Log in to your Entitle accountNavigate to Organization Settings → TokensClick Create Token or Generate New TokenProvide a name/description for the tokenCopy the token immediately (it will only be shown once)Store it securely in your secret management system
  → View detailed instructions https://docs.beyondtrust.com/entitle/docs/org-settings#view-and-manage-tokens
  Important: API tokens are organization-level credentials. Treat them as sensitive secrets and never commit them to version control.
  Configuring the API Key
  The API key can be provided in two ways:
  Option 1: Provider configuration block
  
  provider "entitle" {
    api_key = var.entitle_api_key
  }
  
  Option 2: Environment variable
  
  export ENTITLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
  
  Regional Endpoints
  Entitle provides different API endpoints based on your organization's region:
  | Region | Endpoint URL | Usage |
  |--------|--------------|-------|
  | **EU (Default)** | `https://api.entitle.io` | European region (default) |
  | **US** | `https://api.us.entitle.io` | United States region |
  How to determine your region:
  Check your Entitle login URL or contact your Entitle administratorYour organization's region is determined during initial setupIf unsure, the default EU endpoint is https://api.entitle.io
  The following environment variables can be used as an alternative to provider configuration:
  | Environment Variable | Description |
  |---------------------|-------------|
  | `ENTITLE_API_KEY` | API key for authentication |
  | `ENTITLE_ENDPOINT` | API endpoint URL |
