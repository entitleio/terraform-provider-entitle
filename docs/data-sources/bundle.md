  Entitle bundle is a set of entitlements that can be requested, approved, or revoked by users in a single action, and set in a policy by the admin. Each entitlement can provide the user with access to a resource, which can be as fine-grained as a MongoDB table for example, usually by the use of a “Role”. Thus, one can think of a bundle as a cross-application super role. Read more about bundles https://docs.beyondtrust.com/entitle/docs/bundles.

# entitle_bundle (Data Source)

Entitle bundle is a set of entitlements that can be requested, approved, or revoked by users in a single action, and set in a policy by the admin. Each entitlement can provide the user with access to a resource, which can be as fine-grained as a MongoDB table for example, usually by the use of a “Role”. Thus, one can think of a bundle as a cross-application super role. [Read more about bundles](https://docs.beyondtrust.com/entitle/docs/bundles).

```terraform
data "entitle_bundle" "example" {
