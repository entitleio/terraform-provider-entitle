  An Entitle policy is a rule that automatically manages users' birthright permissions. It assigns a predefined set of permissions to a group of users. When a user joins the group—such as when they join the organization—they are automatically granted the group's permissions. Conversely, when they leave the group—such as when they leave the organization—those permissions are automatically revoked.Read more about policies https://docs.beyondtrust.com/entitle/docs/birthright-policies.
