# entitle_workflow (Resource)

A workflow in Entitle is a generic description of Just-In-Time permissions approval process, which is triggered after the permissions were requested by a user. Who should approve by approval order, to whom, and for how long. After the workflow is defined, it can be assigned to multiple entities which are part of the Just-In-Time permissions approval process: integrations, resources, roles and bundles.

Every workflow is comprised of multiple rules. Their order of is important, the first rule to be validated sets the actual approval process for the permissions request.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "entitle_workflow" "example" {
  name = "example"
  rules = [
    {
      any_schedule = true
      approval_flow = {
        steps = [
          {
            approval_entities = [
              {
                type = "Automatic"
              }
            ]
            notified_entities = []
            operator          = "or"
            sort_order        = 1
          }
        ]
      }

      in_groups      = []
      in_schedules   = []
      sort_order     = 1
      under_duration = 3600
    }
  ]
}
