### Complete License Distribution (27 packages total)

| License | Count | Percentage | Compatibility |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------|
| MPL-2.0 | 9 | 33.3% | ✅ Native |
| MIT | 6 | 22.2% | ✅ Compatible |
| BSD-3-Clause | 6 | 22.2% | ✅ Compatible |
| Apache-2.0 | 4 | 14.8% | ✅ Compatible |
| BSD-2-Clause | 2 | 7.4% | ✅ Compatible |

### License Compatibility Assessment

**✅ ALL DEPENDENCIES ARE COMPATIBLE** with MPL-2.0:

- **Permissive Licenses** (MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause): These can be freely combined with MPL-2.0 code
- **Apache-2.0**: Compatible with MPL-2.0, both are copyleft licenses with similar patent protection clauses
- **MPL-2.0**: Native compatibility (same license)

**❌ NO PROBLEMATIC LICENSES FOUND**:
- No GPL variants (GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0)
- No LGPL variants
- No proprietary or restrictive licenses

## Why MPL-2.0 is the Correct Choice

### 1. **HashiCorp Ecosystem Alignment**
- Terraform itself is MPL-2.0 licensed
- All HashiCorp Terraform-related libraries use MPL-2.0
- Ensures consistency across the Terraform provider ecosystem
- 9 out of 27 dependencies (33%) already use MPL-2.0

### 2. **Business-Friendly Copyleft**
- **File-level copyleft**: Only modifications to MPL-licensed files must be shared
- **Allows proprietary combinations**: Can be combined with proprietary code in separate files
- **Commercial use friendly**: No restrictions on commercial usage or distribution
- **Patent protection**: Includes patent grant and termination clauses

### 3. **Technical Benefits**
- **Dynamic linking allowed**: Libraries can be dynamically linked without license propagation
- **Executable distribution**: Compiled binaries can be distributed under different terms
- **Modification requirements**: Only source changes to MPL files need to be disclosed

### 4. **Legal Clarity**
- Well-established license with clear legal precedents
- Maintained by Mozilla Foundation with regular updates
- Clear compatibility matrix with other open source licenses

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Continue Using MPL-2.0
**MAINTAIN the current MPL-2.0 license** for the following reasons:

1. ✅ **Perfect dependency compatibility** - no license conflicts
2. ✅ **Ecosystem alignment** - matches Terraform and HashiCorp standards  
3. ✅ **Commercial viability** - allows business use without restrictions
4. ✅ **Community acceptance** - widely adopted in infrastructure tooling

### Implementation Requirements

1. **License Header Consistency**
   - Ensure all source files contain proper MPL-2.0 headers
   - Current format in `main.go` is correct:
   ```go
   // Copyright (c) Entitle, Inc.
   // Copyright (c) HashiCorp, Inc.
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0
   ```

2. **Dependency Monitoring**
   - Implement regular license scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor for new dependencies that might introduce incompatible licenses
   - Use the provided license analysis script for ongoing compliance

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep LICENSE file current and accurate
   - Document license choice in README.md if desired
   - Maintain copyright notices for both Entitle and HashiCorp

## Alternative Licenses Considered

### Apache-2.0
- **Pros**: Very permissive, good patent protection, widely adopted
- **Cons**: Different from HashiCorp ecosystem standard, would create inconsistency
- **Verdict**: Not recommended due to ecosystem misalignment

### MIT/BSD
- **Pros**: Maximum permissiveness, simple terms
- **Cons**: No patent protection, too permissive for infrastructure tooling, ecosystem misalignment
- **Verdict**: Not recommended for Terraform providers

### GPL Variants
- **Pros**: Strong copyleft protection
- **Cons**: Too restrictive for business use, incompatible with HashiCorp ecosystem
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for Terraform providers
