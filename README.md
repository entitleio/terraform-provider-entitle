<h1>Entitle Terraform Provider</h1>
</div>

The Terraform Provider for Entitle allows you to manage resources and data sources related to Entitle, a platform that provides a seamless way to grant employees granular and just-in-time access within cloud infrastructures and SaaS applications.

### Supported Resources
* **Workflow** (`entitle_workflow`) — A Just-In-Time approval process: who approves, in what order, for how long. Assignable to integrations, resources, roles, and bundles.
* **Integration** (`entitle_integration`) — A configured connection to a specific instance of an application (e.g. a particular AWS account, GitHub org, or Slack workspace), including credentials and access settings.
* **Resource** (`entitle_resource`) — An entity within an integration that users can gain access to via a role (e.g. a database, repository, or user group).
* **Role** (`entitle_role`) — The atomic permission unit within a resource (e.g. `readonly`, `admin`). Roles can carry their own workflow, allowed durations, and prerequisite permissions.
* **Bundle** (`entitle_bundle`) — A cross-application package of roles that can be requested or revoked as a single action — effectively a "super role" spanning multiple integrations.
* **Policy** (`entitle_policy`) — A rule that automatically grants birthright permissions to users in a group, and revokes them on group leave.
* **Agent Token** (`entitle_agent_token`) — Credential used by the on-prem Entitle Agent to authenticate with the platform when connecting private/internal systems.
* **Permission** (`entitle_permission`) — **Import-only.** Represents an active granted entitlement; created by Entitle through the request/approval flow. Use this to bring existing permissions under Terraform management for tracking or bulk revocation.
* **Access Request Forward** (`entitle_access_request_forward`) — Delegates a user's pending access request responsibilities to a colleague (vacation, leave, role change).
* **Access Review Forward** (`entitle_access_review_forward`) — Delegates a user's access review responsibilities during periodic review campaigns.

### Supported Data Sources

The provider also exposes 17 data sources for looking up existing Entitle objects (use these instead of hardcoding UUIDs in your configuration):

| Singular (lookup one)              | Plural (list / filter)      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `entitle_user`                     | `entitle_users`             |
| `entitle_role`                     | `entitle_roles`             |
| `entitle_resource`                 | `entitle_resources`         |
| `entitle_workflow`                 | —                           |
| `entitle_bundle`                   | —                           |
| `entitle_policy`                   | —                           |
| `entitle_integration`              | —                           |
| `entitle_agent_token`              | —                           |
| `entitle_access_request_forward`   | —                           |
| `entitle_access_review_forward`    | —                           |
| —                                  | `entitle_accounts`          |
| —                                  | `entitle_applications`      |
| —                                  | `entitle_directory_groups`  |
| —                                  | `entitle_permissions`       |

## Prerequisites

Before using the Entitle Terraform Provider, ensure you have the following:

### Provider Configuration
Configure the Entitle Terraform Provider with your API key and endpoint:

* `api_key` (Required): The API key for authenticating with the Entitle API.
* `endpoint` (Optional): The URL endpoint for the Entitle API. default: https://api.entitle.io.

To use the Entitle Terraform Provider, you must configure it with the necessary authentication details.

```hcl
provider "entitle" {
  api_key = "your_api_key"
  endpoint = "https://api.entitle.io"
}
```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine 
(see [Requirements](#requirements) below).

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.24.3

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:


To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in 
the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

before starting you need to overide the configuration for the terraform provider to be search first of all localy in
`$GOPATH/bin`

```hcl
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "entitleio/entitle" = "/absolute/path/to/your/GOPATH/bin"  # e.g. "/Users/you/go/bin" — Terraform does not expand $GOPATH; the path must be literal
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```
